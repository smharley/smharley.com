# Understanding the Challenge

Material Security had a unique positioning in the security market. Founded by former Dropbox engineers, they took a counterintuitive approach to email security:

* Rather than trying to prevent attacks, they focused on protecting valuable information hackers target once they've breached inboxes
* The company was operating under the code name Stellarite since 2017 and preparing to emerge from stealth mode
* They needed a digital presence that would clearly communicate their value proposition while establishing them as a serious enterprise security player
* Security professionals (CSOs and CISOs) needed to quickly understand Material's unique approach compared to traditional solutions

With just six weeks before their June 30th public unveiling, I was tasked with transforming 80% complete static mockups into a fully functional, responsive website while completing the remaining design work.

# Project Constraints

Creating an effective solution required navigating significant constraints:

* **Tight timeline:** With only six weeks until the announcement date, we needed to prioritize critical elements while establishing a foundation for future growth
* **Incomplete design assets:** The design agency had provided desktop-only mockups that were approximately 80% complete
* **Technical environment:** We needed to integrate with Material's existing TypeScript-based repository
* **Brand evolution:** As Material transitioned from Stellarite to Material Security, maintaining consistent branding was crucial

These constraints demanded a pragmatic, iterative approach that prioritized launch-critical elements while building a sustainable foundation for their growing team.

# Core Interface Design

I implemented a mobile-first development approach despite the desktop-focused design mockups, which proved invaluable for ensuring a truly responsive experience:

* **Component architecture:** I implemented styled-components within React for component-scoped styles that prevented conflicts
* **Responsive typography:** A custom scaling system for responsive typography that adjusted text sizes proportionally to viewport width
* **Design tokens:** Reusable design constants for consistent branding across components
* **Visual hierarchy:** Careful attention to spacing and typography ensured readability on all devices while maintaining the sophisticated, enterprise-ready feel

By building from the smallest viewport up, we identified design issues early and created more robust components that would work across the entire user experience.

# Content Management System

With the core interface established, I focused on implementing Prismic CMS to give Material's marketing team content independence:

* **TypeScript integration:** When we started, Prismic didn't have native TypeScript support. I worked directly with the Prismic team to help develop TypeScript definitions
* **Modular slices:** Development of reusable "slices" - modular content components that the marketing team could arrange and customize
* **Template system:** Creation of flexible templates for various content types including product pages and blog posts
* **Content workflow:** Establishment of editorial workflows allowing for content staging and review

These capabilities empowered the marketing team to create new pages that maintained design consistency without requiring developer intervention for every content update — critical for a company that was refining its messaging and growing rapidly.

# Advanced Features

Once the core website was functional, I focused on more sophisticated elements that would elevate the user experience:

* **Illustration system:** Custom illustrations that visualized complex security concepts in an approachable way while maintaining brand consistency
* **Animation system:** Subtle animations that reinforced Material's brand personality while highlighting key security concepts, carefully optimized for performance
* **Asset production pipeline:** An efficient workflow for exporting and optimizing assets from design files, reducing the time required for routine image creation
* **Performance optimization:** Careful attention to load times and Core Web Vitals to ensure a smooth experience for enterprise customers

These enhancements helped Material communicate complex security concepts clearly while maintaining a professional, cutting-edge digital presence.

# Launch and Impact

We successfully launched the new Material Security website to coincide with their emergence from stealth mode on June 30, 2020:

* **Complete digital presence:** A compelling homepage, detailed product pages, team information, and initial blog content
* **Responsive experience:** Fully functional across mobile and desktop devices despite the original desktop-first designs
* **Market positioning:** Clear communication of Material's unique approach to email security
* **Industry attention:** The launch generated significant attention, with security professionals praising the clarity of Material's messaging

Following the initial launch, we continued to refine and expand the website as Material Security grew, developing an expanded illustration system and creating a streamlined process for blog content creation as they prepared for their Series B and Series C funding announcements.

# Outcomes and Lessons

The Material Security website project successfully addressed the initial challenges while creating sustainable systems for future growth:

* **Mobile-first approach:** Resulted in a truly responsive experience despite starting with desktop-focused designs
* **Component architecture:** Created reusable building blocks that maintained consistency while allowing for flexibility
* **CMS implementation:** Empowered the marketing team, significantly reducing the need for developer intervention

The systems established during this project—from the component architecture to the content management approach—continued to serve Material well beyond the initial launch, creating efficiencies for their marketing team and a consistent experience for their users. This foundation helped support Material through their continued growth, including their $40 million Series B and $100 million Series C funding rounds, on their path to becoming a unicorn valued at $1.1 billion.
